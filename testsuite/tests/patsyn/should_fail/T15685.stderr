    • Could not deduce: a ~ [k0]
      from the context: as ~ (a1 : as1)
        bound by a pattern with constructor:
                   Here :: forall {a1} (f :: a1 -> *) (a2 :: a1) (as :: [a1]).
                           f a2 -> NS f (a2 : as),
                 in a pattern synonym declaration
        at T15685.hs:13:19-26
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the inferred type of HereNil :: NS f as
        at T15685.hs:13:9-15
      Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘HereNil’
    • In the pattern: Nil
      In the pattern: Here Nil
      In the declaration for pattern synonym ‘HereNil’

    • Could not deduce: p ~ p1

        bound by a pattern with constructor:
                   Nil :: forall {k} (a :: k). Thrist a a,

      ‘p’ is a rigid type variable bound by

      Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘go’
    • In the expression: acc
      In an equation for ‘go’: go Nil acc = acc
    • Relevant bindings include
        acc :: p (bound at T7438.hs:6:8)
        go :: Thrist a b -> p -> p1 (bound at T7438.hs:6:1)

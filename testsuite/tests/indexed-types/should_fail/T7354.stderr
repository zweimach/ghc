    • Couldn't match type ‘p’ with ‘Base t (Prim [p] p)’
      Expected: Prim [p] p -> Base t (Prim [p] p)
        Actual: Prim [p] p -> p
      ‘p’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the inferred type of foo :: Prim [p] p -> t
        at T7354.hs:28:1-13
    • In the first argument of ‘ana’, namely ‘alg’
      In the expression: ana alg
      In an equation for ‘foo’: foo = ana alg
    • Relevant bindings include
        foo :: Prim [p] p -> t (bound at T7354.hs:28:1)

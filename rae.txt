QUESTIONS:
- Check decideQuantification!

- Is it useful to keep vanilla skolems separate from ordinary tyvars? I think
not.

- Is the whole analyzeType thing paying its weight? Not sure. Antal thinks so.
Perhaps using RecordWildCards for the construction of TypeAnalysis would ease
some syntax annoyance. Anyway, keeping for now. If reverting, look for commits
mentioning "reducing" and "TyCoRep"

- Should TYPE / Levity / Lifted / Unlifted be in the Prelude? If not,
how to deal with :info, which suppresses output that mentions un-imported things.
Current sol'n: make these things BuiltInSyntax.
- Deferred type errors seems to be working with unlifted equality. WHAT?!?

- No anonymous dependent binders in case alternative patterns.

- think about induction recursion
- TH will need some updating -- in particular, its treatment of quantification
  over kinds (quantification forbidden) and types (quantification required)
  is problematic.

- vectoriser code uses dataConRepArgTys. This value changed for Eq#, whose argument
changed from a proper arg to an existential covar arg. Does this matter?
(Other uses of dataConRepArgTys are OK.)

- Writing a bogus GADT return type causes a panic. The problem is that
checkValidDataCon is supposed to check if rejigConRes was valid. To do
this, checkValidDataCon needs the user-specified result type. Normally,
this is retrieved from dataConOrigResTy. The problem is that, now, 
the dataConOrigResTy is substed by the kind substitution produced in
rejigConRes. This is an ugly circular dependency. We could (1) store the
original, unsubsted result ty in the DataCon for just this reason, or
(2) install lots of ugly plumbing in TcTyClsDecls to carry the unsubsted
result ty, or (3) do something else. I want SPJ's input, as both (1)
and (2) are terrible.

fix:
  - Deferred kind errors! Right now, evBindsSubst just silently fails,
    creating core-lint errors. Proposed solution: box the equality.
    Then use the desugared, unpacked boxed equality in terms, but
    use a UnivCo with a clear provenance in types. A bogus type
    coercion can't, by itself, make a program go wrong.

  - unifyWantedLikeEv handles coercions. But make sure other, similar scenarios
    do too.

  - Make sure coercions in types get optimised, too.

  - The flattening story is subtler than I thought. Consider flattening
    Proxy Age (3 |> sym axAge) (w.r.t. nominal equality). We'll get
    the ill-typed Proxy Age 3! This is because, of course, (3 |> sym axAge)
    and 3 are nominally equal. This is terrible. My best guess as to the
    solution is to flatten the (3 |> sym axAge), and then to flatten
    representationally the kind, and then repair the damage by transitivity.

    (UPDATE: Maybe not. If we treated a TyConApp like nested AppTys, we
    would get ((Proxy Age |> (axAge -> *)) 3), which is well-typed.
    Errr... never mind. That new type isn't nominally equal to the original
    type because it changes the kind of an application. Maybe this
    is all a moot point because of that restriction. Or: it's a moot
    point for AppTys, but not TyConApps. That's very silly. Think more
    about it.)

    And it gets worse. Let (T :: forall k1 k2. k1 k2 -> *), where
    type role T rep nom nom.
    Consider flattening representationally
    (T MyMaybe Age (Just (3 |> sym axAge) |> sym axMyMaybe)). We want
    to get (T Maybe Age (Just (3 |> sym axAge))). Nominally flattening
    the third arg will yield (Just 3). The original 3rd kind is
    MyMaybe Age. Rep flattening that will yield Maybe Int. And we somehow
    have to figure out that the correct kind is Maybe Age! Maybe use
    tcMatchTys to match the actual kind up with the template (from T's kind)?
    Then, we can figure out the roles and flatten piece by piece.
    This is painful.

    And, the whole Note [Phantoms in the flattener] is bogus. This is
    because a phantom's type might have been flattened, and so the phantom
    itself must be flattened, too. It's safe just to nominally flatten
    the phantom, because that will have the desired effect on the phantom's
    type. Urgh.

    And when fixing this, be careful about the fact that lots of the flattener
    assumes that things aren't phantoms.

    Search for "very wrong" in TcFlatten.

    More thoughts: When flattening a telescope of arguments, we could track
    the changes in earlier arguments and simply emit Wanted coercions for
    the remaining ones. That is: flatten, and then stick on a cast by a
    fresh wanted coercion, built from the changes made in the earlier,
    dependent arguments.

    Even more thought: Argh! This is much simpler than I thought. Just treat
    TyConApps like nested AppTys, and all is well.

  - I think we can remove TcCoercions, by adding a new EvTerm that contains
    a TcEvBinds for local assumptions. The only point of TcCoercions is
    TcLetCo, and I think this can be subsumed.
  - look for uses of eqType. The typechecker should really stick to tcEqType!
    BUT: consider making Constraint ~R *. Then, tcEqType & eqType are the same.
  - when -fprint-explicit-coercions is on, make sure to print any types
    of printed coboxes.
  - have Core Lint check to make sure RHSs of `let (x :: foo ~# bar) = ...`
    are really Coercions!
  - make use of uo_thing in more error messages
  - check out typecheck/should_compile/tc167.hs. It might be possible to
    do better here. (About weird typing rule for (->))
  - do we need to annotate kind variables to have a proper CUSK? I think so.
    Here is Doel's example from Hac Phi of this problem at the term level:

       type family Wat (t :: k) :: *
       type instance Wat (t :: *) = Int
       type instance Wat (t :: * -> *) = Double

       data T (t :: k) = forall (t' :: k). T (Proxy t') (Wat t')

       -- foo :: forall f. T f
       foo = T (Proxy :: Proxy Maybe) 1.0

  - should check to make sure a coercion isn't bound in a recursive let (!)
  - mkExpectedActualMsg has a lot of backward-compatibility stuff
  - after DeriveAnyClass is fixed (#9968), make sure that the use of looser
    tcUnifyTys in deriveTyData isn't causing problems.
  - add CoreLint checks for levity polymorphism used the right way. But, what exactly
    is the right way??
  - need an -fprint-explicit-coercions, which is off by default.
- Are there uses of the `OrCoVar` functions that could be streamlined?
  Also, look at uses of isCoercionType in module Id
- figure out how to handle the range of equalities. In particular,
  fix classifyPredType,
  - consider re-engineering the boxity problems in solver. look for the "LikeEv" functions
    then "ew" check in DsBinds, and Note [TcCoercion kinds] in DsBinds.

  - Update formalism.
     * NoSubKinds
     * Π
  - Do we need special rule for boxity of ($)? I don't think so, anymore. SPJ agrees. Maybe.
  - consider merging Kind into Type
  - there is tracking of type vs kind in RnTypes. Much can be removed, but
    we want to preserve errors for silly kinds when extensions are off,
    so it can't be taken out entirely. I posit that, absent extension tracking,
    we wouldn't need to track types vs kinds here.
  - pattern synonyms: they can have existential covars, now, right?
            and: make sure they set givens correctly in TcPat (re dep_eq_spec)
  - hsq_implict --> hsq_undeclared; hsq_explicit --> hsq_declared
  - coreExpandTyCon_maybe and tcExpandTyCon_maybe must look at kinds.
  - kind inference should use the "matchExpected..." functions;
    merge matchExpectedFunKind with a type-level thing.
  - APromotionErr (?)
  - Remove TcRnTypes.hs-boot. See comment near top of TcEvidence.
  - no check for silliness like `data T :: T -> *`.
  - :kind in GHCi is unhappy with 
    data Sg (s :: *) (t :: TyFun s * -> *) :: * where
      (:&) :: Pi (fst :: s) -> t @@ fst -> Sg s t

  - prevent dependent variables without -XStarInStar
  - the kind-var finder in zonkRule only looks in tyvars. look in covars? how
    to identify type-level covars? does this matter?
  - add VisibilityFlag to Anon... see if we can sort out some constraint/* nonsense. Also, add relevance info to Anon, and work Binders into Lam and Case. This also allows us to get rid of DFunTy in iface/* stuff.
  - The parsing story is terrible terrible. Fix!
  - comments in DataCon. Are they still correct?
  - sometimes, coercions might get printed in error messages. These should be suppressed unless enabled by a flag.
  - no more deferred type errors for gadts... no more non-dependent gadt equalities, either
  - perhaps change promoteCoercion --> promoteCoercion_maybe that fails if
    it can't do any optimization.
  - consider removing CoercionArg.
  - changed newSigTyVar *not* to make a new unique. OK? This is necessary because
    we need to be able to match up undeclared (but user-written) kind variables
    before and after kind-checking.

please remove:
--------------------------------
- tryTcS now rolls back calls to setTyVarBind and setEvBind. Why setEvBind? Because
  there may be nested EvBindsVars that get twiddled.

- Removed `instance Eq Type`.

- zonking in TcHsSyn must be lazy in types, killing some optimizations and the use of setIdType. Is there a way forward?

- Note [Flavours with boxities] in TcFlatten is interesting.

- znokCtEvidence now does more zonking, because I needed that in simplifyInfer.

- Test uses of unifyType_ and unifyKind to make sure that kind families are tolerated
in those positions.

- UNPACKing lifted equality in data constructors has become harder.
  See comments in MkId.mk_pred_strict_mark.

- Restored MaybeNew because we need to be able to use ctEvCoherence

- It would seem that classes can't have (~#) superclasses. These superclasses
would be encoded as existential variables on the datacon for the class, which
is a Bad Thing. But, I don't think this restriction would bite in practice.

- Somehow related to the last point (but I'm not sure exactly how), we also
can't use superclass equalities "right away". E.g.:
  class k1 ~ k2 => Foo (a :: k1) (b :: k2)
  data SameKind (a :: k) (b :: k)
  foo :: forall (a :: k1) (b :: k2). Foo a b => SameKind a b

To get the above to be accepted, we would need to add a (k1 ~# k2) constraint,
which should logically be implied by `Foo a b`. This will be confusing, but
because we can't have superclass selectors in coercions, there isn't an easy
fix here. (The problem, at its core, is that dictionaries can be bottom.)
Perhaps Pi-quantify the dictionary somehow? Anyway, this is enough of a corner
case to defer.

- Also related: transSuperClasses emits a kind equality from a type equality.
Otherwise, we get only representational equality when emitting deriveds during
solving, which is too weak.

- dataConWrappers now are rejigged w.r.t. GADTs. This is just simpler and
  has no user effect.

- I removed the "Do not float kind-incompatible equalities" check from
floatEqualities. While the idea behind this check is still valid, the
mechanics (a simple `eqType`) are not. If something breaks, I'll fix it.

- I'm becoming uncomfortable with the unlifted evbinds stuff. Too much special-
casing throughout DsBinds. For example, see dsTcCoercion and dsEvTermUnlifted.
Is there a better design?

- New HsWrapper WpEvPrimApp, for unboxed coercion application

- uType now returns a Coercion, not a TcCoercion. unifyType still deals in
TcCoercions.

- TcCoercions can be hetero.

- mkTcEqPred is sometime hetero. I think this is OK.

- Loosened some roles. For example, the role on the eta coercion in the
hetero forall coercions is now parametric, not N. And, the role on the
type-cast coercion is R, not N. See also email *to* SCW (with no written response)
on 7/14/14. The end of the discussion was to go with that email's Coherence1
rule, which doesn't cause problems (other than some discomfort, as outlined
in the email.)

- The kind-role rejiggering. But, I think this is resolved now, and I'm happy
  with it.

- UnivCo --> PhantomCo and UnsafeCo, because phantom coercions should exist
  only between types with representationally-equal kinds. Argh.

- rejigConRes is *much* more involved than it was. But this seems reasonable.

- Taken from kindGeneralize:
                -- ToDo: remove the (filter isKindVar)
                -- Any type variables in tkvs will be in scope,
                -- and hence in gbl_tvs, so after removing gbl_tvs
                -- we should only have kind variables left
		--
 		-- BUT there is a smelly case (to be fixed when TH is reorganised)
		--     f t = [| e :: $t |]
                -- When typechecking the body of the bracket, we typecheck $t to a
                -- unification variable 'alpha', with no biding forall.  We don't
                -- want to kind-quantify it!

- Is it bad to accept higher-rank kinds? For example, SPJ is worried that by allowing
higher-rank kinds to exist, it may hamstring us later when extending the kind system.
The current, rather simplistic higher-rank-kind algorithm critically depends on the
lack of type-level lambdas.

- instance (Typeable s, Typeable a) => Typeable (s a) now needs UndecidableInstances
because of the appearance of a repeated kind variable on the left of the arrow.
This actually looks legit.

- Some interesting stuff is in TcHsType.splitTelescopeTvs, in particular see
Note [Typechecking telescopes].

- We are now instantiating tycons at application sites, not var sites. Very
interesting from a theoretical standpoint.

- There is a general assumption that all types are implicit in terms. This will have
  to be revisited. In particular, all usages of the splitForAllTys functions will
  need to be re-checked. Also, I think the following functions will need to be changed:
   - mkLams
   - tcInstType
   - tcSplitDFunTy
   - toIfaceClassOp

- Why isn't CPush implemented near Simplify.lhs:1200?

- Poly-kinded typeable goes to lengths to ensure that only *kind* variables
  are around. This seems unnecessary. I've removed the code. Let's see if
  anything breaks -- it should break rather obviously.

- (Removed) Note [Do not create Given kind equalities] says
  "But the Right Thing is to add kind equalities!"

- Old check for TF termination omitted kind vars. New check does not.

- sizeType (coercion) = 1, in TcValidity. check?

- *ALL* types are now kinds (of course). Including things like Double and IO.

- No kind unification algorithm (separate from that for types)

- No two coercions of the same type are ever apart.

- Promoted covar arguments in promoted datacons have role P.

- flattening a coercion flattens the types it coerces.

- I'm confused about roles in kinds.

(old):
- move promoteKind to Kind    
- tcDataFamInstDecl seems to need more recursive information to get isPromotable right.
- genGenericMetaTyCons makes unpromotable things. Why?

After compiling:
- consider adding full definition of lifting to core-spec.
- use optType throughout code
- revisit MatchM monad
- consider removing typesCantMatch from Unify, in favor of apartness checking
- consider rewriting match in terms of unify.
- make CoVar constructor of Var
- merge tcView and coreView??


Notes:

- Role inference ignores coercions. (But think about this more, perhaps.) Why?
  Because a kind cast cannot affect a representation. But, I still don't quite
  know what theorem should be maintained by the |-ctr judgment. In particular,
  I'm worried that *any* replacement in kind coercions will lead to ill-typed
  terms.

 - the solver works over lifted equalities, which are homogeneous. This
   rather limits the usefulness of hetero equalities, which are now
   barred from ever seeing the inside of the inference engine. Is this
   sensible?
   A: NO!! Instead, just use Cast operator, as per Skype conversation with SCW
      on July 30.
   --> UPDATE: The Cast operator doesn't compose, because we won't be able to
               build composite coercions in types. We could define T.F.s for
               the different coercion constructors, but this won't work for
               forall. And it's a bit icky.
   Plan of record: Have solver deal with both lifted and unlifted equality. This
   is actually not too difficult. We just need to take some care in desugaring.
   But I'm not *very* happy with it.
   NEW PLAN: Just rewrite the solver in terms of unlifted equality.

BUGS:
#9017

----------------------------------------
Stuff for implementing Π:

RAE is taking a break.
  - deeplySkolemise and its one use in tcGen have different types. Sort this out.
  - deeplyInstantiate needs to be just like deeplySkolemise, but different.
  - Phase information flows *up*, never *down*. That is, we always infer
    phase information and then check when necessary. We don't try to check
    phases top-down. This avoids the need for dependence meta-variables.
  - How to deal with unifying Ids? This will be a problem in deeplyInstantiate.
  - We'll need a new EvTerm (and possibly a new HsWrapper) which stores a tyvar
    to be demoted.

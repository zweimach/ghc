 * Note [Non-moving garbage collector]
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * The sources rts/NonMoving*.c implement GHC's non-moving garbage collector
 * for the oldest generation. In contrast to the throughput-oriented moving
 * collector, the non-moving collector is designed to achieve low GC latencies
 * on large heaps. It accomplishes low-latencies by way of a concurrent
 * mark-and-sweep collection strategy on a specially-designed heap structure.
 * While the design is described in detail in the design document found in
 * docs/storage/nonmoving-gc, we briefly summarize the structure here.
 *
 *
 * === Heap Structure ===
 *
 * The nonmoving heap (embodied by struct NonmovingHeap) consists of a family
 * of allocators, each serving a range of allocation sizes. Each allocator
 * consists of a set of *segments*, each of which contain fixed-size *blocks*
 * (not to be confused with "blocks" provided by GHC's block allocator; this is
 * admittedly an unfortunate overlap in terminology).  These blocks are the
 * backing store for the allocator. In addition to blocks, the segment also
 * contains some header information (see struct NonmovingSegment in
 * NonMoving.h). This header contains a *bitmap* encoding one byte per block
 * (used by the collector to record liveness), as well as the index of the next
 * unallocated block (and a *snapshot* of this field which will be described in
 * the next section).
 *
 * Each allocator maintains three sets of segments:
 *
 *  - A *current* segment for each capability; this is the segment which that
 *    capability will allocate into.
 *
 *  - A pool of *active* segments, each of which containing at least one
 *    unallocated block. The allocate will take a segment from this pool when
 *    it fills its *current* segment.
 *
 *  - A set of *filled* segments, which contain no unallocated blocks and will
 *    be collected during the next major GC cycle
 *
 * Storage for segments is allocated using the block allocator using an aligned
 * group of NONMOVING_SEGMENT_BLOCKS blocks. This makes the task of locating
 * the segment header for a clone a simple matter of bit-masking (as
 * implemented by nonmovingGetSegment).
 *
 * In addition, to relieve pressure on the block allocator we keep a small pool
 * of free blocks around (nonmovingHeap.free) which can be pushed/popped
 * to/from in a lock-free manner.
 *
 *
 * === Allocation ===
 *
 * The allocator (as implemented by nonmovingAllocate) starts by identifying
 * which allocator the request should be made against. It then allocates into
 * its local current segment and bumps the next_free pointer to point to the
 * next unallocated block (as indicated by the bitmap). If it finds the current
 * segment is now full it moves it to the filled list and looks for a new
 * segment to make current from a few sources:
 *
 *  1. the allocator's active list (see pop_active_segment)
 *  2. the nonmoving heap's free block pool (see nonmovingPopFreeSegment)
 *  3. allocate a new segment from the block allocator (see
 *     nonmovingAllocSegment)
 *
 * Note that allocation does *not* involve modifying the bitmap. The bitmap is
 * only modified by the collector.
 *
 *
 * === Snapshot invariant ===
 *
 * To safely collect in a concurrent setting, the collector relies on the
 * notion of a *snapshot*. The snapshot is a hypothetical frozen state of the
 * heap topology taken at the beginning of the major collection cycle.
 * With this definition we require the following property of the mark phase,
 * which we call the *snapshot invariant*,
 *
 *     All objects that were reachable at the time the snapshot was collected
 *     must have their mark bits set at the end of the mark phase.
 *
 * As the mutator might change the topology of the heap while we are marking
 * this property requires some cooperation from the mutator to maintain.
 * Specifically, we rely on a write barrier as described in Note [Update
 * remembered set].
 *
 * To determine which objects were existent when the snapshot was taken we
 * record a snapshot of each segments next_free pointer at the beginning of
 * collection.
 *
 *
 * === Collection ===
 *
 * Collection happens in a few phases some of which occur during a
 * stop-the-world period (marked with [STW]) and others which can occur
 * concurrently with mutation and minor collection (marked with [CONC]):
 *
 *  1. [STW] Preparatory GC: Here we do a standard minor collection of the
 *     younger generations (which may evacuate things to the nonmoving heap).
 *     References from younger generations into the nonmoving heap are recorded
 *     in the mark queue (see Note [Aging under the non-moving collector] in
 *     this file).
 *
 *  2. [STW] Snapshot update: Here we update the segment snapshot metadata
 *     (see nonmovingPrepareMark) and move the filled segments to
 *     nonmovingHeap.sweep_list, which is the set of segments which we will
 *     sweep this GC cycle.
 *
 *  3. [STW] Root collection: Here we walk over a variety of root sources
 *     and add them to the mark queue (see nonmovingCollect).
 *
 *  4. [CONC] Concurrent marking: Here we do the majority of marking concurrently
 *     with mutator execution (but with the write barrier enabled; see
 *     Note [Update remembered set]).
 *
 *  5. [STW] Final sync: Here we interrupt the mutators, ask them to
 *     flush their final update remembered sets, and mark any new references
 *     we find.
 *
 *  6. [CONC] Sweep: Here we walk over the nonmoving segments on sweep_list
 *     and place them back on either the active, current, or filled list,
 *     depending upon how much live data they contain.
 *
 *
 * === Marking ===
 *
 * Ignoring large and static objects, marking a closure is fairly
 * straightforward (implemented in NonMovingMark.c:mark_closure):
 *
 *  1. Check whether the closure is in the non-moving generation; if not then
 *     we ignore it.
 *  2. Find the segment containing the closure's block.
 *  3. Check whether the closure's block is above $seg->next_free_snap; if so
 *     then the block was not allocated when we took the snapshot and therefore
 *     we don't need to mark it.
 *  4. Check whether the block's bitmap bits is equal to nonmovingMarkEpoch. If
 *     so then we can stop as we have already marked it.
 *  5. Push the closure's pointers to the mark queue.
 *  6. Set the blocks bitmap bits to nonmovingMarkEpoch.
 *
 * Note that the ordering of (5) and (6) is rather important, as described in
 * Note [StgStack dirtiness flags and concurrent marking].
 *

 *
 *
 * Note [Concurrent non-moving collection]
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Concurrency-control of non-moving garbage collection is a bit tricky. There
 * are a few things to keep in mind:
 *
 *  - Only one non-moving collection may be active at a time. This is enforced by the
 *    concurrent_coll_running flag, which is set when a collection is on-going. If
 *    we attempt to initiate a new collection while this is set we wait on the
 *    concurrent_coll_finished condition variable, which signals when the
 *    active collection finishes.
 *
 *  - In between the mark and sweep phases the non-moving collector must synchronize
 *    with mutator threads to collect and mark their final update remembered
 *    sets. This is accomplished using
 *    stopAllCapabilitiesWith(SYNC_FLUSH_UPD_REM_SET). Capabilities are held
 *    the final mark has concluded.
 *
 * Note that possibility of concurrent minor and non-moving collections
 * requires that we handle static objects a bit specially. See
 * Note [Static objects under the nonmoving collector] in Storage.c
 * for details.
 *
 *
 * Note [Aging under the non-moving collector]
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * The initial design of the non-moving collector mandated that all live data
 * be evacuated to the non-moving heap prior to a major collection. This
 * simplified certain bits of implementation and eased reasoning. However, it
 * was (unsurprisingly) also found to result in significant amounts of
 * unnecessary copying.
 *
 * Consequently, we now allow aging. Aging allows the preparatory GC leading up
 * to a major collection to evacuate some objects into the young generation.
 * However, this introduces the following tricky case that might arise after
 * we have finished the preparatory GC:
 *
 *       moving heap  ┆  non-moving heap
 *     ───────────────┆──────────────────
 *                    ┆
 *      B ←────────────── A ←─────────────── root
 *      │             ┆     ↖─────────────── gen1 mut_list
 *      ╰───────────────→ C
 *                    ┆
 *
 * In this case C is clearly live, but the non-moving collector can only see
 * this by walking through B, which lives in the moving heap. However, doing so
 * would require that we synchronize with the mutator/minor GC to ensure that it
 * isn't in the middle of moving B. What to do?
 *
 * The solution we use here is to teach the preparatory moving collector to
 * "evacuate" objects it encounters in the non-moving heap by adding them to
 * the mark queue. This is implemented by pushing the object to the update
 * remembered set of the capability held by the evacuating gc_thread
 * (implemented by markQueuePushClosureGC)
 *
 * Consequently collection of the case above would proceed as follows:
 *
 *  1. Initial state:
 *      * A lives in the non-moving heap and is reachable from the root set
 *      * A is on the oldest generation's mut_list, since it contains a pointer
 *        to B, which lives in a younger generation
 *      * B lives in the moving collector's from space
 *      * C lives in the non-moving heap
 *
 *  2. Preparatory GC: Scavenging mut_lists:
 *
 *     The mut_list of the oldest generation is scavenged, resulting in B being
 *     evacuated (aged) into the moving collector's to-space.
 *
 *  3. Preparatory GC: Scavenge B
 *
 *     B (now in to-space) is scavenged, resulting in evacuation of C.
 *     evacuate(C) pushes a reference to C to the mark queue.
 *
 *  4. Non-moving GC: C is marked
 *
 *     The non-moving collector will come to C in the mark queue and mark it.
 *
 *
 * Note [Deadlock detection under the non-moving collector]
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * In GHC the garbage collector is responsible for identifying deadlocked
 * programs. Providing for this responsibility is slightly tricky in the
 * non-moving collector due to the existence of aging. In particular, the
 * non-moving collector cannot traverse objects living in a young generation
 * but reachable from the non-moving generation, as described in Note [Aging
 * under the non-moving collector].
 *
 * However, this can pose trouble for deadlock detection since it means that we
 * may conservatively mark dead closures as live. Consider this case:
 *
 *       moving heap  ┆  non-moving heap
 *     ───────────────┆──────────────────
 *                    ┆
 *      MVAR_QUEUE ←───── TSO ←───────────── gen1 mut_list
 *        ↑  │  ╰────────↗  │
 *        │  │        ┆     │
 *        │  │        ┆     ↓
 *        │  ╰──────────→ MVAR
 *        ╰─────────────────╯
 *                    ┆
 *
 * In this case we have a TSO blocked on a dead MVar. Because the MVAR_TSO_QUEUE on
 * which it is blocked lives in the moving heap, the TSO is necessarily on the
 * oldest generation's mut_list. As in Note [Aging under the non-moving
 * collector], the MVAR_TSO_QUEUE will be evacuated. If MVAR_TSO_QUEUE is aged
 * (e.g. evacuated to the young generation) then the MVAR will be added to the
 * mark queue. Consequently, we will falsely conclude that the MVAR is still
 * alive and fail to spot the deadlock.
 *
 * To avoid this sort of situation we disable aging when we are starting a
 * major GC specifically for deadlock detection (as done by
 * scheduleDetectDeadlock). This condition is recorded by the
 * deadlock_detect_gc global variable declared in GC.h. Setting this has a few
 * effects on the preparatory GC:
 *
 *  - Evac.c:alloc_for_copy forces evacuation to the non-moving generation.
 *
 *  - The evacuation logic usually responsible for pushing objects living in
 *    the non-moving heap to the mark queue is disabled. This is safe because
 *    we know that all live objects will be in the non-moving heap by the end
 *    of the preparatory moving collection.
 *
 *
 * Note [Live data accounting in nonmoving collector]
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * The nonmoving collector uses an approximate heuristic for reporting live
 * data quantity. Specifically, during mark we record how much live data we
 * find in nonmoving_live_words. At the end of mark we declare this amount to
 * be how much live data we have on in the nonmoving heap (by setting
 * oldest_gen->live_estimate).
 *
 * In addition, we update oldest_gen->live_estimate every time we fill a
 * segment. This, as well, is quite approximate: we assume that all blocks
 * above next_free_next are newly-allocated. In principle we could refer to the
 * bitmap to count how many blocks we actually allocated but this too would be
 * approximate due to concurrent collection and ultimately seems more costly
 * than the problem demands.
 *
 *
 * Note [Spark management under the nonmoving collector]
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Every GC, both minor and major, prunes the spark queue (using
 * Sparks.c:pruneSparkQueue) of sparks which are no longer reachable.
 * Doing this with concurrent collection is a tad subtle since the minor
 * collections cannot rely on the mark bitmap to accurately reflect the
 * reachability of a spark.
 *
 * We use a conservative reachability approximation:
 *
 *  - Minor collections assume that all sparks living in the non-moving heap
 *    are reachable.
 *
 *  - Major collections prune the spark queue during the final sync. This pruning
 *    assumes that all sparks in the young generations are reachable (since the
 *    BF_EVACUATED flag won't be set on the nursery blocks) and will consequently
 *    only prune dead sparks living in the non-moving heap.
 *
 *
 * Note [Dirty flags in the non-moving collector]
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Some mutable object types (e.g. MUT_VARs, TVARs) have a one-bit dirty flag
 * encoded in their info table pointer. The moving collector uses this flag
 * to minimize redundant mut_list entries. The flag is preserves the following
 * simple invariant:
 *
 *     An object being marked as dirty implies that the object is on mut_list.
 *
 * This allows a nice optimisation in the write barrier (e.g. dirty_MUT_VAR):
 * if we write to an already-dirty object there is no need to
 * push it to the mut_list as we know it's already there.
 *
 * During GC (scavenging) we will then keep track of whether all of the
 * object's reference have been promoted. If so we can mark the object as clean.
 * If not then we re-add it to mut_list and mark it as dirty.
 *
 * In the non-moving collector we use the same dirty flag to implement a
 * related optimisation on the non-moving write barrier: Specifically, the
 * snapshot invariant only requires that the non-moving write barrier applies
 * to the *first* mutation to an object after collection begins. To achieve this,
 * we impose the following invariant:
 *
 *     An object being marked as dirty implies that all of its fields are on
 *     the mark queue (or, equivalently, update remembered set).
 *
 * With this guarantee we can safely make the write barriers dirty objects
 * no-ops. We perform this optimisation for the following object types:
 *
 *  - MVAR
 *  - TVAR
 *  - MUT_VAR
 *
 * However, maintaining this invariant requires great care. For instance,
 * consider the case of an MVar (which has two pointer fields) before
 * preparatory collection:
 *
 *    Non-moving heap     ┊      Moving heap
 *         gen 1          ┊         gen 0
 *  ──────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────
 *                        ┊
 *         MVAR A  ────────────────→ X
 *        (dirty)  ───────────╮
 *                        ┊   ╰────→ Y
 *                        ┊          │
 *                        ┊          │
 *           ╭───────────────────────╯
 *           │            ┊
 *           ↓            ┊
 *           Z            ┊
 *                        ┊
 *
 * During the preparatory collection we promote Y to the nonmoving heap but
 * fail to promote X. Since the failed_to_evac field is conservative (being set
 * if *any* of the fields are not promoted), this gives us:
 *
 *    Non-moving heap     ┊      Moving heap
 *         gen 1          ┊         gen 0
 *  ──────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────
 *                        ┊
 *         MVAR A  ────────────────→ X
 *        (dirty)         ┊
 *           │            ┊
 *           │            ┊
 *           ↓            ┊
 *           Y            ┊
 *           │            ┊
 *           │            ┊
 *           ↓            ┊
 *           Z            ┊
 *                        ┊
 *
 * This is bad. When we resume mutation a mutator may mutate MVAR A; since it's
 * already dirty we would fail to add Y to the update remembered set, breaking the
 * snapshot invariant and potentially losing track of the liveness of Z.
 *
 * To avoid this nonmovingScavengeOne we eagerly pushes the values of the
 * fields of all objects which it fails to evacuate (e.g. MVAR A) to the update
 * remembered set during the preparatory GC. This allows us to safely skip the
 * non-moving write barrier without jeopardizing the snapshot invariant.

Note [What is this unwinding business?]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unwinding tables are a variety of debugging information used by debugging tools
to reconstruct the execution history of a program at runtime. These tables
consist of sets of "instructions", one set for every point in the program, which
describe how to reconstruct the state of the machine at the point where the
current procedure was called. For instance, consider the following pseudo-code,

    add rsp, 8            -- unwind: rsp = rsp - 8
    mov rax, 1            -- unwind: rax = unknown
    call another_block    --
TODO: Finish this

Currently we only bother to produce unwinding information for registers which
are necessary to reconstruct flow-of-execution. On x86_64 this includes $rbp
(which is the STG stack pointer) and $rsp (the C stack pointer).

The flow of unwinding information is a bit convoluted:

 * Unwinding nodes (CmmUnwind nodes) are initially created during code
   STG-to-C-- code generation. In particular, StgCmmForeign produces an
   unwinding node describing the saving and restoration of the thread state in
   the TSO over a safe foreign call.

 * The unwinding nodes are carried through the C-- common-block elimination and
   proc-point passes. Thankfully none of these passes should mess with the code
   in ways that will jeopardize the validity of the unwinding information (e.g.
   adds or removes modifications to Sp), so no particular care is needed here.

 * CmmLayoutStack produces an unwinding node for the adjustment of the STG Sp
   register which it inserts at the end of blocks.

 * The unwind nodes are carried through the sinking pass. This one way be a
   little delicate and in principle this pass probably ought to learn to update
   unwinding nodes, but in practice it doesn't seem to interfere.

 * Eventually we make it to the code generator backend which can then preserve
   the unwind nodes in its machine-specific instructions. In so doing the
   backend can also modify or add unwinding information; this is necessary, for
   instance, in the case of x86-64, where adjustment of $rsp may be necessary
   during calls to native foreign code due to the native calling convention.

 * The NCG then retreives the final unwinding table for each block from the
   backend with generateUnwindTable.

 * This unwind information is then converted to, e.g., DWARF unwinding tables
   and emitted in the final object.

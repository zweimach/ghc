Note [Top-level evidence]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Top-level evidence bindings may be mutually recursive with the top-level value
bindings, so we must put those in a Rec.  But we can't put them *all* in a Rec
because the occurrence analyser doesn't take account of type/coercion variables
when computing dependencies.

So we pull out the type/coercion variables (which are in dependency order),
and Rec the rest.

Note [Adding export flags]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Set the no-discard flag if either
        a) the Id is exported
        b) it's mentioned in the RHS of an orphan rule
        c) it's in the keep-alive set

It means that the binding won't be discarded EVEN if the binding
ends up being trivial (v = w) -- the simplifier would usually just
substitute w for v throughout, but we don't apply the substitution to
the rules (maybe we should?), so this substitution would make the rule
bogus.

You might wonder why exported Ids aren't already marked as such;
it's just because the type checker is rather busy already and
I didn't want to pass in yet another mapping.

Note [Attach rules to local ids]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Find the rules for locally-defined Ids; then we can attach them
to the binders in the top-level bindings

Reason
  - It makes the rules easier to look up
  - It means that rewrite rules and specialisations for
    locally defined Ids are handled uniformly
  - It keeps alive things that are referred to only from a rule
    (the occurrence analyser knows about rules attached to Ids)
  - It makes sure that, when we apply a rule, the free vars
    of the RHS are more likely to be in scope
  - The imported rules are carried in the in-scope set
    which is extended on each iteration by the new wave of
    local binders; any rules which aren't on the binding will
    thereby get dropped

{- Note [Desugaring RULE left hand sides]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For the LHS of a RULE we do *not* want to desugar
    [x]   to    build (\cn. x `c` n)
We want to leave explicit lists simply as chains
of cons's. We can achieve that slightly indirectly by
switching off EnableRewriteRules.  See GHC.HsToCore.Expr.dsExplicitList.

That keeps the desugaring of list comprehensions simple too.

Nor do we want to warn of conversion identities on the LHS;
the rule is precisely to optimise them:
  {-# RULES "fromRational/id" fromRational = id :: Rational -> Rational #-}

Note [Desugaring coerce as cast]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We want the user to express a rule saying roughly “mapping a coercion over a
list can be replaced by a coercion”. But the cast operator of Core (▷) cannot
be written in Haskell. So we use `coerce` for that (#2110). The user writes
    map coerce = coerce
as a RULE, and this optimizes any kind of mapped' casts away, including `map
MkNewtype`.

For that we replace any forall'ed `c :: Coercible a b` value in a RULE by
corresponding `co :: a ~#R b` and wrap the LHS and the RHS in
`let c = MkCoercible co in ...`. This is later simplified to the desired form
by simpleOptExpr (for the LHS) resp. the simplifiers (for the RHS).
See also Note [Getting the map/coerce RULE to work] in GHC.Core.SimpleOpt.

Note [Rules and inlining/other rules]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have
  f x = ...
  g x = ...
  {-# RULES "rule-for-f" forall x. f (g x) = ... #-}
then there's a good chance that in a potential rule redex
    ...f (g e)...
then 'f' or 'g' will inline before the rule can fire.  Solution: add an
INLINE [n] or NOINLINE [n] pragma to 'f' and 'g'.

Note that this applies to all the free variables on the LHS, both the
main function and things in its arguments.

We also check if there are Ids on the LHS that have competing RULES.
In the above example, suppose we had
  {-# RULES "rule-for-g" forally. g [y] = ... #-}
Then "rule-for-f" and "rule-for-g" would compete.  Better to add phase
control, so "rule-for-f" has a chance to fire before "rule-for-g" becomes
active; or perhaps after "rule-for-g" has become inactive. This is checked
by 'competesWith'

Class methods have a built-in RULE to select the method from the dictionary,
so you can't change the phase on this.  That makes id very dubious to
match on class methods in RULE lhs's.   See #10595.   I'm not happy
about this. For example in Control.Arrow we have

{-# RULES "compose/arr"   forall f g .
                          (arr f) . (arr g) = arr (f . g) #-}

and similar, which will elicit exactly these warnings, and risk never
firing.  But it's not clear what to do instead.  We could make the
class method rules inactive in phase 2, but that would delay when
subsequent transformations could fire.

Note [Patching magic definitions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We sometimes need to have access to defined Ids in pure contexts. Usually, we
simply "wire in" these entities, as we do for types in GHC.Builtin.Types and for Ids
in GHC.Types.Id.Make. See Note [Wired-in Ids] in GHC.Types.Id.Make.

However, it is sometimes *much* easier to define entities in Haskell,
even if we need pure access; note that wiring-in an Id requires all
entities used in its definition *also* to be wired in, transitively
and recursively.  This can be a huge pain.  The little trick
documented here allows us to have the best of both worlds.

Motivating example: unsafeCoerce#. See [Wiring in unsafeCoerce#] for the
details.

The trick is to

* Define the known-key Id in a library module, with a stub definition,
     unsafeCoerce# :: ..a suitable type signature..
     unsafeCoerce# = error "urk"

* Magically over-write its RHS here in the desugarer, in
  patchMagicDefns.  This update can be done with full access to the
  DsM monad, and hence, dsLookupGlobal. We thus do not have to wire in
  all the entities used internally, a potentially big win.

  This step should not change the Name or type of the Id.

Because an Id stores its unfolding directly (as opposed to in the second
component of a (Id, CoreExpr) pair), the patchMagicDefns function returns
a new Id to use.

Here are the moving parts:

- patchMagicDefns checks whether we're in a module with magic definitions;
  if so, patch the magic definitions. If not, skip.

- patchMagicDefn just looks up in an environment to find a magic defn and
  patches it in.

- magicDefns holds the magic definitions.

- magicDefnsEnv allows for quick access to magicDefns.

- magicDefnModules, built also from magicDefns, contains the modules that
  need careful attention.

Note [Wiring in unsafeCoerce#]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We want (Haskell)

  unsafeCoerce# :: forall (r1 :: RuntimeRep) (r2 :: RuntimeRep)
                          (a :: TYPE r1) (b :: TYPE r2).
                   a -> b
  unsafeCoerce# x = case unsafeEqualityProof @r1 @r2 of
    UnsafeRefl -> case unsafeEqualityProof @a @b of
      UnsafeRefl -> x

or (Core)

  unsafeCoerce# :: forall (r1 :: RuntimeRep) (r2 :: RuntimeRep)
                          (a :: TYPE r1) (b :: TYPE r2).
                   a -> b
  unsafeCoerce# = \ @r1 @r2 @a @b (x :: a).
    case unsafeEqualityProof @RuntimeRep @r1 @r2 of
      UnsafeRefl (co1 :: r1 ~# r2) ->
        case unsafeEqualityProof @(TYPE r2) @(a |> TYPE co1) @b of
          UnsafeRefl (co2 :: (a |> TYPE co1) ~# b) ->
            (x |> (GRefl :: a ~# (a |> TYPE co1)) ; co2)

It looks like we can write this in Haskell directly, but we can't:
the levity polymorphism checks defeat us. Note that `x` is a levity-
polymorphic variable. So we must wire it in with a compulsory
unfolding, like other levity-polymorphic primops.

The challenge is that UnsafeEquality is a GADT, and wiring in a GADT
is *hard*: it has a worker separate from its wrapper, with all manner
of complications. (Simon and Richard tried to do this. We nearly wept.)

The solution is documented in Note [Patching magic definitions]. We now
simply look up the UnsafeEquality GADT in the environment, leaving us
only to wire in unsafeCoerce# directly.

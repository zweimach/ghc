{- Note [Type normalisation]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Constructs like -XEmptyCase or a previous unsuccessful pattern match on a data
constructor place a non-void constraint on the matched thing. This means that it
boils down to checking whether the type of the scrutinee is inhabited. Function
pmTopNormaliseType gets rid of the outermost type function/data family redex and
newtypes, in search of an algebraic type constructor, which is easier to check
for inhabitation.

It returns 3 results instead of one, because there are 2 subtle points:
1. Newtypes are isomorphic to the underlying type in core but not in the source
   language,
2. The representational data family tycon is used internally but should not be
   shown to the user

Hence, if pmTopNormaliseType env ty_cs ty = Just (src_ty, dcs, core_ty),
then
  (a) src_ty is the rewritten type which we can show to the user. That is, the
      type we get if we rewrite type families but not data families or
      newtypes.
  (b) dcs is the list of newtype constructors "skipped", every time we normalise
      a newtype to its core representation, we keep track of the source data
      constructor. For convenience, we also track the type we unwrap and the
      type of its field. Example: @Down 42@ => @[(Down @Int, Down, Int)]
  (c) core_ty is the rewritten type. That is,
        pmTopNormaliseType env ty_cs ty = Just (src_ty, dcs, core_ty)
      implies
        topNormaliseType_maybe env ty = Just (co, core_ty)
      for some coercion co.

To see how all cases come into play, consider the following example:

  data family T a :: *
  data instance T Int = T1 | T2 Bool
  -- Which gives rise to FC:
  --   data T a
  --   data R:TInt = T1 | T2 Bool
  --   axiom ax_ti : T Int ~R R:TInt

  newtype G1 = MkG1 (T Int)
  newtype G2 = MkG2 G1

  type instance F Int  = F Char
  type instance F Char = G2

In this case pmTopNormaliseType env ty_cs (F Int) results in

  Just (G2, [(G2,MkG2,G1),(G1,MkG1,T Int)], R:TInt)

Which means that in source Haskell:
  - G2 is equivalent to F Int (in contrast, G1 isn't).
  - if (x : R:TInt) then (MkG2 (MkG1 x) : F Int).

-----
-- Wrinkle: Local equalities
-----

Given the following type family:

  type family F a
  type instance F Int = Void

Should the following program (from #14813) be considered exhaustive?

  f :: (i ~ Int) => F i -> a
  f x = case x of {}

You might think "of course, since `x` is obviously of type Void". But the
idType of `x` is technically F i, not Void, so if we pass F i to
inhabitationCandidates, we'll mistakenly conclude that `f` is non-exhaustive.
In order to avoid this pitfall, we need to normalise the type passed to
pmTopNormaliseType, using the constraint solver to solve for any local
equalities (such as i ~ Int) that may be in scope.

any entry in 'vi_neg' must be incomparable to C (return Nothing) according to
'eqPmAltCons'. Those entries that are comparable either lead to a refutation
or are redundant. Examples:
* @x ~ Just y@, @x /~ [Just]@. 'eqPmAltCon' returns @Equal@, so refute.
* @x ~ Nothing@, @x /~ [Just]@. 'eqPmAltCon' returns @Disjoint@, so negative
  info is redundant and should be discarded.
* @x ~ I# y@, @x /~ [4,2]@. 'eqPmAltCon' returns @PossiblyOverlap@, so orthogal.
  We keep this info in order to be able to refute a redundant match on i.e. 4
  later on.

This carries over to pattern synonyms and overloaded literals. Say, we have
    pattern Just42 = Just 42
    case Just42 of x
      Nothing -> ()
      Just _  -> ()
Even though we had a solution for the value abstraction called x here in form
of a PatSynCon (Just42,[]), this solution is incomparable to both Nothing and
Just. Hence we retain the info in vi_neg, which eventually allows us to detect
the complete pattern match.

The Pos/Neg invariant extends to vi_cache, which stores essentially positive
information. We make sure that vi_neg and vi_cache never overlap. This isn't
strictly necessary since vi_cache is just a cache, so doesn't need to be
accurate: Every suggestion of a possible ConLike from vi_cache might be
refutable by the type oracle anyway. But it helps to maintain sanity while
debugging traces.

Note [Why record both positive and negative info?]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You might think that knowing positive info (like x ~ Just y) would render
negative info irrelevant, but not so because of pattern synonyms.  E.g we might
know that x cannot match (Foo 4), where pattern Foo p = Just p

Also overloaded literals themselves behave like pattern synonyms. E.g if
postively we know that (x ~ I# y), we might also negatively want to record that
x does not match 45 f 45       = e2 f (I# 22#) = e3 f 45       = e4  --
Overlapped

Note [TmState invariants]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The term oracle state is never obviously (i.e., without consulting the type
oracle) contradictory. This implies a few invariants:
* Whenever vi_pos overlaps with vi_neg according to 'eqPmAltCon', we refute.
  This is implied by the Note [Pos/Neg invariant].
* Whenever vi_neg subsumes a COMPLETE set, we refute. We consult vi_cache to
  detect this, but we could just compare whole COMPLETE sets to vi_neg every
  time, if it weren't for performance.

Maintaining these invariants in 'addVarCt' (the core of the term oracle) and
'addNotConCt' is subtle.
* Merging VarInfos. Example: Add the fact @x ~ y@ (see 'equate').
  - (COMPLETE) If we had @x /~ True@ and @y /~ False@, then we get
    @x /~ [True,False]@. This is vacuous by matter of comparing to the built-in
    COMPLETE set, so should refute.
  - (Pos/Neg) If we had @x /~ True@ and @y ~ True@, we have to refute.
* Adding positive information. Example: Add the fact @x ~ K ys@ (see 'addConCt')
  - (Neg) If we had @x /~ K@, refute.
  - (Pos) If we had @x ~ K2@, and that contradicts the new solution according to
    'eqPmAltCon' (ex. K2 is [] and K is (:)), then refute.
  - (Refine) If we had @x /~ K zs@, unify each y with each z in turn.
* Adding negative information. Example: Add the fact @x /~ Nothing@ (see 'addNotConCt')
  - (Refut) If we have @x ~ K ys@, refute.
  - (COMPLETE) If K=Nothing and we had @x /~ Just@, then we get
    @x /~ [Just,Nothing]@. This is vacuous by matter of comparing to the built-in
    COMPLETE set, so should refute.

Note that merging VarInfo in equate can be done by calling out to 'addConCt' and
'addNotConCt' for each of the facts individually.

Note [Representation of Strings in TmState]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Instead of treating regular String literals as a PmLits, we treat it as a list
of characters in the oracle for better overlap reasoning. The following example
shows why:

  f :: String -> ()
  f ('f':_) = ()
  f "foo"   = ()
  f _       = ()

The second case is redundant, and we like to warn about it. Therefore either
the oracle will have to do some smart conversion between the list and literal
representation or treat is as the list it really is at runtime.

The "smart conversion" has the advantage of leveraging the more compact literal
representation wherever possible, but is really nasty to get right with negative
equalities: Just think of how to encode @x /= "foo"@.
The "list" option is far simpler, but incurs some overhead in representation and
warning messages (which can be alleviated by someone with enough dedication).

{- Note [COMPLETE sets on data families]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
User-defined COMPLETE sets involving data families are attached to the family
TyCon, whereas the built-in COMPLETE set is attached to a data family instance's
representation TyCon. This matters for COMPLETE sets involving both DataCons
and PatSyns (from #17207):

  data family T a
  data family instance T () = A | B
  pattern C = B
  {-# COMPLETE A, C #-}
  f :: T () -> ()
  f A = ()
  f C = ()

The match on A is actually wrapped in a CoPat, matching impedance between T ()
and its representation TyCon, which we translate as
@x | let y = x |> co, A <- y@ in PmCheck.

Which TyCon should we use for looking up the COMPLETE set? The representation
TyCon from the match on A would only reveal the built-in COMPLETE set, while the
data family TyCon would only give the user-defined one. But when initialising
the PossibleMatches for a given Type, we want to do so only once, because
merging different COMPLETE sets after the fact is very complicated and possibly
inefficient.

So in fact, we just *drop* the coercion arising from the CoPat when handling
handling the constraint @y ~ x |> co@ in addCoreCt, just equating @y ~ x@.
We then handle the fallout in initPossibleMatches, which has to get a hand at
both the representation TyCon tc_rep and the parent data family TyCon tc_fam.
It considers three cases after having established that the Type is a TyConApp:

1. The TyCon is a vanilla data type constructor
2. The TyCon is tc_rep
3. The TyCon is tc_fam

1. is simple and subsumed by the handling of the other two.
We check for case 2. by 'tyConFamInst_maybe' and get the tc_fam out.
Otherwise (3.), we try to lookup the data family instance at that particular
type to get out the tc_rep. In case 1., this will just return the original
TyCon, so tc_rep = tc_fam afterwards.

{- Note [Divergence of Newtype matches]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Newtypes behave rather strangely when compared to ordinary DataCons. In a
pattern-match, they behave like a irrefutable (lazy) match, but for inhabitation
testing purposes (e.g. at construction sites), they behave rather like a DataCon
with a *strict* field, because they don't contribute their own bottom and are
inhabited iff the wrapped type is inhabited.

This distinction becomes apparent in #17248:

  newtype T2 a = T2 a
  g _      True = ()
  g (T2 _) True = ()
  g !_     True = ()

If we treat Newtypes like we treat regular DataCons, we would mark the third
clause as redundant, which clearly is unsound. The solution:
1. When desugaring the constructor pattern in 'desugarConPatOut', don't add a
   @PmBang@ on the match variable, because the match will never diverge.
2. Regard @T2 x@ as 'canDiverge' iff @x@ 'canDiverge'. E.g. @T2 x ~ _|_@ <=>
   @x ~ _|_@. This way, the third clause will still be marked as inaccessible
   RHS instead of redundant. This is ensured by calling 'lookupVarInfoNT'.
3. When we find @x ~ T2 y@, transfer all constraints on @x@ (which involve @⊥@)
   @y@, similar to what 'equate' does.
4. Immediately reject when we find @x /~ T2@.
Handling of Newtypes is also described in the Appendix of the Lower Your Guards paper,
where you can find the solution in a perhaps more digestible format.

Is the first match exhaustive on the PRead synonym? Should the second line thus
deemed redundant? The answer is, of course, No! The required theta is like a
hidden parameter which must be supplied at the pattern match site, so PRead
is much more like a view pattern (where behavior depends on the particular value
passed in).
The simple solution here is to forget in 'addNotConCt' that we matched
on synonyms with a required Theta like @PRead@, so that subsequent matches on
the same constructor are never flagged as redundant. The consequence is that
we no longer detect the actually redundant match in

    g :: String -> Int
    g (PRead x) = x
    g (PRead y) = y -- redundant!
    g _         = 0

-- * Detecting vacuous types

{- Note [Checking EmptyCase Expressions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Empty case expressions are strict on the scrutinee. That is, `case x of {}`
will force argument `x`. Hence, `covCheckMatches` is not sufficient for checking
empty cases, because it assumes that the match is not strict (which is true
for all other cases, apart from EmptyCase). This gave rise to #10746. Instead,
we do the following:

1. We normalise the outermost type family redex, data family redex or newtype,
   using pmTopNormaliseType (in "GHC.Core.FamInstEnv"). This computes 3
   things:
   (a) A normalised type src_ty, which is equal to the type of the scrutinee in
       source Haskell (does not normalise newtypes or data families)
   (b) The actual normalised type core_ty, which coincides with the result
       topNormaliseType_maybe. This type is not necessarily equal to the input
       type in source Haskell. And this is precicely the reason we compute (a)
       and (c): the reasoning happens with the underlying types, but both the
       patterns and types we print should respect newtypes and also show the
       family type constructors and not the representation constructors.

   (c) A list of all newtype data constructors dcs, each one corresponding to a
       newtype rewrite performed in (b).

   For an example see also Note [Type normalisation]
   in "GHC.Core.FamInstEnv".

2. Function Check.checkEmptyCase' performs the check:
   - If core_ty is not an algebraic type, then we cannot check for
     inhabitation, so we emit (_ :: src_ty) as missing, conservatively assuming
     that the type is inhabited.
   - If core_ty is an algebraic type, then we unfold the scrutinee to all
     possible constructor patterns, using inhabitationCandidates, and then
     check each one for constraint satisfiability, same as we do for normal
     pattern match checking.

{- Note [Strict argument type constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the ConVar case of clause processing, each conlike K traditionally
generates two different forms of constraints:

* A term constraint (e.g., x ~ K y1 ... yn)
* Type constraints from the conlike's context (e.g., if K has type
  forall bs. Q => s1 .. sn -> T tys, then Q would be its type constraints)

As it turns out, these alone are not enough to detect a certain class of
unreachable code. Consider the following example (adapted from #15305):

  data K = K1 | K2 !Void

  f :: K -> ()
  f K1 = ()

Even though `f` doesn't match on `K2`, `f` is exhaustive in its patterns. Why?
Because it's impossible to construct a terminating value of type `K` using the
`K2` constructor, and thus it's impossible for `f` to ever successfully match
on `K2`.

The reason is because `K2`'s field of type `Void` is //strict//. Because there
are no terminating values of type `Void`, any attempt to construct something
using `K2` will immediately loop infinitely or throw an exception due to the
strictness annotation. (If the field were not strict, then `f` could match on,
say, `K2 undefined` or `K2 (let x = x in x)`.)

Since neither the term nor type constraints mentioned above take strict
argument types into account, we make use of the `nonVoid` function to
determine whether a strict type is inhabitable by a terminating value or not.
We call this the "inhabitation test".

`nonVoid ty` returns True when either:
1. `ty` has at least one InhabitationCandidate for which both its term and type
   constraints are satisfiable, and `nonVoid` returns `True` for all of the
   strict argument types in that InhabitationCandidate.
2. We're unsure if it's inhabited by a terminating value.

`nonVoid ty` returns False when `ty` is definitely uninhabited by anything
(except bottom). Some examples:

* `nonVoid Void` returns False, since Void has no InhabitationCandidates.
  (This is what lets us discard the `K2` constructor in the earlier example.)
* `nonVoid (Int :~: Int)` returns True, since it has an InhabitationCandidate
  (through the Refl constructor), and its term constraint (x ~ Refl) and
  type constraint (Int ~ Int) are satisfiable.
* `nonVoid (Int :~: Bool)` returns False. Although it has an
  InhabitationCandidate (by way of Refl), its type constraint (Int ~ Bool) is
  not satisfiable.
* Given the following definition of `MyVoid`:

    data MyVoid = MkMyVoid !Void

  `nonVoid MyVoid` returns False. The InhabitationCandidate for the MkMyVoid
  constructor contains Void as a strict argument type, and since `nonVoid Void`
  returns False, that InhabitationCandidate is discarded, leaving no others.
* Whether or not a type is inhabited is undecidable in general.
  See Note [Fuel for the inhabitation test].
* For some types, inhabitation is evident immediately and we don't need to
  perform expensive tests. See Note [Types that are definitely inhabitable].

Note [Fuel for the inhabitation test]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Whether or not a type is inhabited is undecidable in general. As a result, we
can run into infinite loops in `nonVoid`. Therefore, we adopt a fuel-based
approach to prevent that.

Consider the following example:

  data Abyss = MkAbyss !Abyss
  stareIntoTheAbyss :: Abyss -> a
  stareIntoTheAbyss x = case x of {}

In principle, stareIntoTheAbyss is exhaustive, since there is no way to
construct a terminating value using MkAbyss. However, both the term and type
constraints for MkAbyss are satisfiable, so the only way one could determine
that MkAbyss is unreachable is to check if `nonVoid Abyss` returns False.
There is only one InhabitationCandidate for Abyss—MkAbyss—and both its term
and type constraints are satisfiable, so we'd need to check if `nonVoid Abyss`
returns False... and now we've entered an infinite loop!

To avoid this sort of conundrum, `nonVoid` uses a simple test to detect the
presence of recursive types (through `checkRecTc`), and if recursion is
detected, we bail out and conservatively assume that the type is inhabited by
some terminating value. This avoids infinite loops at the expense of making
the coverage checker incomplete with respect to functions like
stareIntoTheAbyss above. Then again, the same problem occurs with recursive
newtypes, like in the following code:

  newtype Chasm = MkChasm Chasm
  gazeIntoTheChasm :: Chasm -> a
  gazeIntoTheChasm x = case x of {} -- Erroneously warned as non-exhaustive

So this limitation is somewhat understandable.

Note that even with this recursion detection, there is still a possibility that
`nonVoid` can run in exponential time. Consider the following data type:

  data T = MkT !T !T !T

If we call `nonVoid` on each of its fields, that will require us to once again
check if `MkT` is inhabitable in each of those three fields, which in turn will
require us to check if `MkT` is inhabitable again... As you can see, the
branching factor adds up quickly, and if the recursion depth limit is, say,
100, then `nonVoid T` will effectively take forever.

To mitigate this, we check the branching factor every time we are about to call
`nonVoid` on a list of strict argument types. If the branching factor exceeds 1
(i.e., if there is potential for exponential runtime), then we limit the
maximum recursion depth to 1 to mitigate the problem. If the branching factor
is exactly 1 (i.e., we have a linear chain instead of a tree), then it's okay
to stick with a larger maximum recursion depth.

In #17977 we saw that the defaultRecTcMaxBound (100 at the time of writing) was
too large and had detrimental effect on performance of the coverage checker.
Given that we only commit to a best effort anyway, we decided to substantially
decrement the recursion depth to 3, at the cost of precision in some edge cases
like

  data Nat = Z | S Nat
  data Down :: Nat -> Type where
    Down :: !(Down n) -> Down (S n)
  f :: Down (S (S (S (S (S Z))))) -> ()
  f x = case x of {}

Since the coverage won't bother to instantiate Down 4 levels deep to see that it
is in fact uninhabited, it will emit a inexhaustivity warning for the case.

Note [Types that are definitely inhabitable]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another microoptimization applies to data types like this one:

  data S a = S ![a] !T

Even though there is a strict field of type [a], it's quite silly to call
nonVoid on it, since it's "obvious" that it is inhabitable. To make this
intuition formal, we say that a type is definitely inhabitable (DI) if:

  * It has at least one constructor C such that:
    1. C has no equality constraints (since they might be unsatisfiable)
    2. C has no strict argument types (since they might be uninhabitable)

It's relatively cheap to check if a type is DI, so before we call `nonVoid`
on a list of strict argument types, we filter out all of the DI ones.

{- Note [Detecting pattern synonym applications in expressions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At the moment we fail to detect pattern synonyms in scrutinees and RHS of
guards. This could be alleviated with considerable effort and complexity, but
the returns are meager. Consider:

    pattern P
    pattern Q
    case P 15 of
      Q _  -> ...
      P 15 ->

Compared to the situation where P and Q are DataCons, the lack of generativity
means we could never flag Q as redundant. (also see Note [Undecidable Equality
for PmAltCons] in PmTypes.) On the other hand, if we fail to recognise the
pattern synonym, we flag the pattern match as inexhaustive. That wouldn't happen
if we had knowledge about the scrutinee, in which case the oracle basically
knows "If it's a P, then its field is 15".

This is a pretty narrow use case and I don't think we should to try to fix it
until a user complains energetically.

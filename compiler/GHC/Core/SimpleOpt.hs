Note [The simple optimiser]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The simple optimiser is a lightweight, pure (non-monadic) function
that rapidly does a lot of simple optimisations, including

  - inlining things that occur just once,
      or whose RHS turns out to be trivial
  - beta reduction
  - case of known constructor
  - dead code elimination

It does NOT do any call-site inlining; it only inlines a function if
it can do so unconditionally, dropping the binding.  It thereby
guarantees to leave no un-reduced beta-redexes.

It is careful to follow the guidance of "Secrets of the GHC inliner",
and in particular the pre-inline-unconditionally and
post-inline-unconditionally story, to do effective beta reduction on
functions called precisely once, without repeatedly optimising the same
expression.  In fact, the simple optimiser is a good example of this
little dance in action; the full Simplifier is a lot more complicated.

  * We do no rule rewrites
  * We do no call-site inlining

Those differences obviate the reasons for not inlining a trivial rhs,
and increase the benefit for doing so.  So we unconditionally inline trivial
rhss here.

Note [Preserve join-binding arity]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Be careful /not/ to eta-reduce the RHS of a join point, lest we lose
the join-point arity invariant.  #15108 was caused by simplifying
the RHS with simple_opt_expr, which does eta-reduction.  Solution:
simplify the RHS of a join point by simplifying under the lambdas
(which of course should be there).

Note [simple_app and join points]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In general for let-bindings we can do this:
   (let { x = e } in b) a  ==>  let { x = e } in b a

But not for join points!  For two reasons:

- We would need to push the continuation into the RHS:
   (join { j = e } in b) a  ==>  let { j' = e a } in b[j'/j] a
                                      NB ----^^
  and also change the type of j, hence j'.
  That's a bit sophisticated for the very simple optimiser.

- We might end up with something like
    join { j' = e a } in
    (case blah of        )
    (  True  -> j' void# ) a
    (  False -> blah     )
  and now the call to j' doesn't look like a tail call, and
  Lint may reject.  I say "may" because this is /explicitly/
  allowed in the "Compiling without Continuations" paper
  (Section 3, "Managing \Delta").  But GHC currently does not
  allow this slightly-more-flexible form.  See GHC.Core
  Note [Join points are less general than the paper].

The simple thing to do is to disable this transformation
for join points in the simple optimiser

Note [The Let-Unfoldings Invariant]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A program has the Let-Unfoldings property iff:

- For every let-bound variable f, whether top-level or nested, whether
  recursive or not:
  - Both the binding Id of f, and every occurrence Id of f, has an idUnfolding.
  - For non-INLINE things, that unfolding will be f's right hand sids
  - For INLINE things (which have a "stable" unfolding) that unfolding is
    semantically equivalent to f's RHS, but derived from the original RHS of f
    rather that its current RHS.

Informally, we can say that in a program that has the Let-Unfoldings property,
all let-bound Id's have an explicit unfolding attached to them.

Currently, the simplifier guarantees the Let-Unfoldings invariant for anything
it outputs.

Note [Inline prag in simplOpt]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If there's an INLINE/NOINLINE pragma that restricts the phase in
which the binder can be inlined, we don't inline here; after all,
we don't know what phase we're in.  Here's an example

  foo :: Int -> Int -> Int
  {-# INLINE foo #-}
  foo m n = inner m
     where
       {-# INLINE [1] inner #-}
       inner m = m+n

  bar :: Int -> Int
  bar n = foo n 1

When inlining 'foo' in 'bar' we want the let-binding for 'inner'
to remain visible until Phase 1

Note [Unfold compulsory unfoldings in LHSs]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the user writes `RULES map coerce = coerce` as a rule, the rule
will only ever match if simpleOptExpr replaces coerce by its unfolding
on the LHS, because that is the core that the rule matching engine
will find. So do that for everything that has a compulsory
unfolding. Also see Note [Desugaring coerce as cast] in GHC.HsToCore.

However, we don't want to inline 'seq', which happens to also have a
compulsory unfolding, so we only do this unfolding only for things
that are always-active.  See Note [User-defined RULES for seq] in GHC.Types.Id.Make.

Note [Getting the map/coerce RULE to work]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We wish to allow the "map/coerce" RULE to fire:

  {-# RULES "map/coerce" map coerce = coerce #-}

The naive core produced for this is

  forall a b (dict :: Coercible * a b).
    map @a @b (coerce @a @b @dict) = coerce @[a] @[b] @dict'

  where dict' :: Coercible [a] [b]
        dict' = ...

This matches literal uses of `map coerce` in code, but that's not what we
want. We want it to match, say, `map MkAge` (where newtype Age = MkAge Int)
too. Some of this is addressed by compulsorily unfolding coerce on the LHS,
yielding

  forall a b (dict :: Coercible * a b).
    map @a @b (\(x :: a) -> case dict of
      MkCoercible (co :: a ~R# b) -> x |> co) = ...

Getting better. But this isn't exactly what gets produced. This is because
Coercible essentially has ~R# as a superclass, and superclasses get eagerly
extracted during solving. So we get this:

  forall a b (dict :: Coercible * a b).
    case Coercible_SCSel @* @a @b dict of
      _ [Dead] -> map @a @b (\(x :: a) -> case dict of
                               MkCoercible (co :: a ~R# b) -> x |> co) = ...

Unfortunately, this still abstracts over a Coercible dictionary. We really
want it to abstract over the ~R# evidence. So, we have Desugar.unfold_coerce,
which transforms the above to (see also Note [Desugaring coerce as cast] in
Desugar)

  forall a b (co :: a ~R# b).
    let dict = MkCoercible @* @a @b co in
    case Coercible_SCSel @* @a @b dict of
      _ [Dead] -> map @a @b (\(x :: a) -> case dict of
         MkCoercible (co :: a ~R# b) -> x |> co) = let dict = ... in ...

Now, we need simpleOptExpr to fix this up. It does so by taking three
separate actions:
  1. Inline certain non-recursive bindings. The choice whether to inline
     is made in simple_bind_pair. Note the rather specific check for
     MkCoercible in there.

  2. Stripping case expressions like the Coercible_SCSel one.
     See the `Case` case of simple_opt_expr's `go` function.

  3. Look for case expressions that unpack something that was
     just packed and inline them. This is also done in simple_opt_expr's
     `go` function.

This is all a fair amount of special-purpose hackery, but it's for
a good cause. And it won't hurt other RULES and such that it comes across.

Suppose we have

discover that f is an arity-2 join point, we'll eta-expand it to

Note [exprIsConApp_maybe]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
exprIsConApp_maybe is a very important function.  There are two principal
uses:
  * case e of { .... }
  * cls_op e, where cls_op is a class operation

In both cases you want to know if e is of form (C e1..en) where C is
a data constructor.

However e might not *look* as if


Note [exprIsConApp_maybe on literal strings]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See #9400 and #13317.

Conceptually, a string literal "abc" is just ('a':'b':'c':[]), but in Core
they are represented as unpackCString# "abc"# by GHC.Core.Make.mkStringExprFS, or
unpackCStringUtf8# when the literal contains multi-byte UTF8 characters.

For optimizations we want to be able to treat it as a list, so they can be
decomposed when used in a case-statement. exprIsConApp_maybe detects those
calls to unpackCString# and returns:

Just (':', [Char], ['a', unpackCString# "bc"]).

We need to be careful about UTF8 strings here. ""# contains a ByteString, so
we must parse it back into a FastString to split off the first character.
That way we can treat unpackCString# and unpackCStringUtf8# in the same way.

We must also be careful about
   lvl = "foo"#
   ...(unpackCString# lvl)...
to ensure that we see through the let-binding for 'lvl'.  Hence the
(exprIsLiteral_maybe .. arg) in the guard before the call to
dealWithStringLiteral.

Note [Push coercions in exprIsConApp_maybe]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In #13025 I found a case where we had
    op (df @t1 @t2)     -- op is a ClassOp
where
    df = (/\a b. K e1 e2) |> g

To get this to come out we need to simplify on the fly
   ((/\a b. K e1 e2) |> g) @t1 @t2

Hence the use of pushCoArgs.

Note [exprIsConApp_maybe on data constructors with wrappers]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Problem:
- some data constructors have wrappers
- these wrappers inline late (see MkId Note [Activation for data constructor wrappers])
- but we still want case-of-known-constructor to fire early.

Example:
   data T = MkT !Int
   $WMkT n = case n of n' -> MkT n'   -- Wrapper for MkT
   foo x = case $WMkT e of MkT y -> blah

Here we want the case-of-known-constructor transformation to fire, giving
   foo x = case e of x' -> let y = x' in blah

Here's how exprIsConApp_maybe achieves this:

0.  Start with scrutinee = $WMkT e

1.  Inline $WMkT on-the-fly.  That's why data-constructor wrappers are marked
    as expandable. (See GHC.Core.Utils.isExpandableApp.) Now we have
      scrutinee = (\n. case n of n' -> MkT n') e

2.  Beta-reduce the application, generating a floated 'let'.
    See Note [beta-reduction in exprIsConApp_maybe] below.  Now we have
      scrutinee = case n of n' -> MkT n'
      with floats {Let n = e}

3.  Float the "case x of x' ->" binding out.  Now we have
      scrutinee = MkT n'
      with floats {Let n = e; case n of n' ->}

And now we have a known-constructor MkT that we can return.

Notice that both (2) and (3) require exprIsConApp_maybe to gather and return
a bunch of floats, both let and case bindings.

Note that this strategy introduces some subtle scenarios where a data-con
wrapper can be replaced by a data-con worker earlier than we’d like, see
Note [exprIsConApp_maybe for data-con wrappers: tricky corner].

Note [beta-reduction in exprIsConApp_maybe]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The unfolding a definition (_e.g._ a let-bound variable or a datacon wrapper) is
typically a function. For instance, take the wrapper for MkT in Note
[exprIsConApp_maybe on data constructors with wrappers]:

    $WMkT n = case n of { n' -> T n' }

If `exprIsConApp_maybe` is trying to analyse `$MkT arg`, upon unfolding of $MkT,
it will see

   (\n -> case n of { n' -> T n' }) arg

In order to go progress, `exprIsConApp_maybe` must perform a beta-reduction.

We don't want to blindly substitute `arg` in the body of the function, because
it duplicates work. We can (and, in fact, used to) substitute `arg` in the body,
but only when `arg` is a variable (or something equally work-free).

But, because of Note [exprIsConApp_maybe on data constructors with wrappers],
'exprIsConApp_maybe' now returns floats. So, instead, we can beta-reduce
_always_:

    (\x -> body) arg

Is transformed into

   let x = arg in body

Which, effectively, means emitting a float `let x = arg` and recursively
analysing the body.

For newtypes, this strategy requires that their wrappers have compulsory unfoldings.
Suppose we have
   newtype T a b where
     MkT :: a -> T b a   -- Note args swapped

This defines a worker function MkT, a wrapper function $WMkT, and an axT:
   $WMkT :: forall a b. a -> T b a
   $WMkT = /\b a. \(x:a). MkT a b x    -- A real binding

   MkT :: forall a b. a -> T a b
   MkT = /\a b. \(x:a). x |> (ax a b)  -- A compulsory unfolding

   axiom axT :: a ~R# T a b

Now we are optimising
   case $WMkT (I# 3) |> sym axT of I# y -> ...
we clearly want to simplify this. If $WMkT did not have a compulsory
unfolding, we would end up with
   let a = I#3 in case a of I# y -> ...
because in general, we do this on-the-fly beta-reduction
   (\x. e) blah  -->  let x = blah in e
and then float the let.  (Substitution would risk duplicating 'blah'.)

But if the case-of-known-constructor doesn't actually fire (i.e.
exprIsConApp_maybe does not return Just) then nothing happens, and nothing
will happen the next time either.

See test T16254, which checks the behavior of newtypes.

Note [Don't float join points]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
exprIsConApp_maybe should succeed on
   let v = e in Just v
returning [x=e] as one of the [FloatBind].  But it must
NOT succeed on
   join j x = rhs in Just v
because join-points can't be gaily floated.  Consider
   case (join j x = rhs in Just) of
     K p q -> blah
We absolutely must not "simplify" this to
   join j x = rhs
   in blah
because j's return type is (Maybe t), quite different to blah's.

You might think this could never happen, because j can't be
tail-called in the body if the body returns a constructor.  But
in !3113 we had a /dead/ join point (which is not illegal),
and its return type was wonky.

The simple thing is not to float a join point.  The next iteration
of the simplifier will sort everything out.  And it there is
a join point, the chances are that the body is not a constructor
application, so failing faster is good.

Note [exprIsConApp_maybe for data-con wrappers: tricky corner]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Generally speaking

  * exprIsConApp_maybe honours the inline phase; that is, it does not look
    inside the unfolding for an Id unless its unfolding is active in this phase.
    That phase-sensitivity is expressed in the InScopeEnv (specifically, the
    IdUnfoldingFun component of the InScopeEnv) passed to exprIsConApp_maybe.

  * Data-constructor wrappers are active only in phase 0 (the last phase);
    see Note [Activation for data constructor wrappers] in GHC.Types.Id.Make.

On the face of it that means that exprIsConApp_maybe won't look inside data
constructor wrappers until phase 0. But that seems pretty Bad. So we cheat.
For data con wrappers we unconditionally look inside its unfolding, regardless
of phase, so that we get case-of-known-constructor to fire in every phase.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, this cheating can backfire. An example:

    data T = C !A B
    foo p q = let x = C e1 e2 in seq x $ f x
    {-# RULE "wurble" f (C a b) = b #-}

In Core, the RHS of foo is

    let x = $WC e1 e2 in case x of y { C _ _ -> f x }

and after doing a binder swap and inlining x, we have:

    case $WC e1 e2 of y { C _ _ -> f y }

Case-of-known-constructor fires, but now we have to reconstruct a binding for
`y` (which was dead before the binder swap) on the RHS of the case alternative.
Naturally, we’ll use the worker:

    case e1 of a { DEFAULT -> let y = C a e2 in f y }

and after inlining `y`, we have:

    case e1 of a { DEFAULT -> f (C a e2) }

Now we might hope the "wurble" rule would fire, but alas, it will not: we have
replaced $WC with C, but the (desugared) rule matches on $WC! We weren’t
supposed to inline $WC yet for precisely that reason (see Note [Activation for
data constructor wrappers]), but our cheating in exprIsConApp_maybe came back to
bite us.

This is rather unfortunate, especially since this can happen inside stable
unfoldings as well as ordinary code (which really happened, see !3041). But
there is no obvious solution except to delay case-of-known-constructor on
data-con wrappers, and that cure would be worse than the disease.

This Note exists solely to document the problem.

Note [Unfolding DFuns]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DFuns look like

  df :: forall a b. (Eq a, Eq b) -> Eq (a,b)
  df a b d_a d_b = MkEqD (a,b) ($c1 a b d_a d_b)
                               ($c2 a b d_a d_b)

So to split it up we just need to apply the ops $c1, $c2 etc
to the very same args as the dfun.  It takes a little more work
to compute the type arguments to the dictionary constructor.

Note [DFun arity check]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here we check that the total number of supplied arguments (including
type args) matches what the dfun is expecting.  This may be *less*
than the ordinary arity of the dfun: see Note [DFun unfoldings] in GHC.Core

Note [exprIsLambda_maybe]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
exprIsLambda_maybe will, given an expression `e`, try to turn it into the form
`Lam v e'` (returned as `Just (v,e')`). Besides using lambdas, it looks through
casts (using the Push rule), and it unfolds function calls if the unfolding
has a greater arity than arguments are present.

Currently, it is used in GHC.Core.Rules.match, and is required to make
"map coerce = coerce" match.

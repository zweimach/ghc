Note [Trees that grow]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/implementing-trees-that-grow

The hsSyn AST is reused across multiple compiler passes. We also have the
Template Haskell AST, and the haskell-src-exts one (outside of GHC)

Supporting multiple passes means the AST has various warts on it to cope with
the specifics for the phases, such as the 'ValBindsOut', 'ConPatOut',
'SigPatOut' etc.

The growable AST will allow each of these variants to be captured explicitly,
such that they only exist in the given compiler pass AST, as selected by the
type parameter to the AST.

In addition it will allow tool writers to define their own extensions to capture
additional information for the tool, in a natural way.

A further goal is to provide a means to harmonise the Template Haskell and
haskell-src-exts ASTs as well.

Wrinkle: In order to print out the AST, we need to know it is Outputable.
We also sometimes need to branch on the particular pass that we're in
(e.g. to print out type information once we know it). In order to allow
both of these actions, we define OutputableBndrId, which gathers the necessary
OutputableBndr and IsPass constraints. The use of this constraint in instances
generally requires UndecidableInstances.

See also Note [IsPass] and Note [NoGhcTc].

Note [IsPass]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One challenge with the Trees That Grow approach
is that we sometimes have different information in different passes.
For example, we have

  type instance XViaStrategy GhcPs = LHsSigType GhcPs
  type instance XViaStrategy GhcRn = LHsSigType GhcRn
  type instance XViaStrategy GhcTc = Type

This means that printing a DerivStrategy (which contains an XViaStrategy)
might need to print a LHsSigType, or it might need to print a type. Yet we
want one Outputable instance for a DerivStrategy, instead of one per pass. We
could have a large constraint, including e.g. (Outputable (XViaStrategy p),
Outputable (XViaStrategy GhcTc)), and pass that around in every context where
we might output a DerivStrategy. But a simpler alternative is to pass a
witness to whichever pass we're in. When we pattern-match on that (GADT)
witness, we learn the pass identity and can then print away. To wit, we get
the definition of GhcPass and the functions isPass. These allow us to do away
with big constraints, passing around all manner of dictionaries we might or
might not use. It does mean that we have to manually use isPass when printing,
but these places are few.

See Note [NoGhcTc] about the superclass constraint to IsPass.

Note [NoGhcTc]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An expression is parsed into HsExpr GhcPs, renamed into HsExpr GhcRn, and
then type-checked into HsExpr GhcTc. Not so for types! These get parsed
into HsType GhcPs, renamed into HsType GhcRn, and then type-checked into
Type. We never build an HsType GhcTc. Why do this? Because we need to be
able to compare type-checked types for equality, and we don't want to do
this with HsType.

This causes wrinkles within the AST, where we normally thing that the whole
AST travels through the GhcPs --> GhcRn --> GhcTc pipeline as one. So we
have the NoGhcTc type family, which just replaces GhcTc with GhcRn, so that
user-written types can be preserved (as HsType GhcRn) even in e.g. HsExpr GhcTc.

For example, this is used in ExprWithTySig:
    | ExprWithTySig
                (XExprWithTySig p)

                (LHsExpr p)
                (LHsSigWcType (NoGhcTc p))

If we have (e :: ty), we still want to be able to print that (with the :: ty)
after type-checking. So we retain the LHsSigWcType GhcRn, even in an
HsExpr GhcTc. That's what NoGhcTc does.

When we're printing the type annotation, we need to know
(Outputable (LHsSigWcType GhcRn)), even though we've assumed only that
(OutputableBndrId GhcTc). We thus must be able to prove OutputableBndrId (NoGhcTc p)
from OutputableBndrId p. The extra constraints in OutputableBndrId and
the superclass constraints of IsPass allow this. Note that the superclass
constraint of IsPass is *recursive*: it asserts that IsPass (NoGhcTcPass p) holds.
For this to make sense, we need -XUndecidableSuperClasses and the other constraint,
saying that NoGhcTcPass is idempotent.

Note [XRec and SrcSpans in the AST]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
XRec is meant to replace most of the uses of `Located` in the AST. It is another
extension point meant to make it easier for non-GHC applications to reuse the
AST for their own purposes, and not have to deal the hassle of (perhaps) useless
SrcSpans everywhere.

instead of `Located (HsExpr p)` or similar types, we will now have `XRec p
(HsExpr p)`

XRec allows annotating certain points in the AST with extra information. This
maybe be source spans (for GHC), nothing (for TH), types (for HIE files), api
annotations (for exactprint) or anything else.

This should hopefully bring us one step closer to sharing the AST between GHC
and TH.

We use the `UnXRec`, `MapXRec` and `WrapXRec` type classes to aid us in writing
pass-polymorphic code that deals with `XRec`s

{-
Note [NoExtCon and strict fields]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently, any unused TTG extension constructor will generally look like the
following:

  type instance XXHsDecl (GhcPass _) = NoExtCon
  data HsDecl p
    = ...
    | XHsDecl !(XXHsDecl p)

The field of type `XXHsDecl p` is strict for a good reason: it allows the
pattern-match coverage checker to conclude that any matches against XHsDecl
are unreachable whenever `p ~ GhcPass _`. To see why this is the case, consider
the following function which consumes an HsDecl:

  ex :: HsDecl GhcPs -> HsDecl GhcRn
  ...
  ex (XHsDecl nec) = noExtCon nec

Because `p` equals GhcPs (i.e., GhcPass 'Parsed), XHsDecl's field has the type
NoExtCon. But since (1) the field is strict and (2) NoExtCon is an empty data
type, there is no possible way to reach the right-hand side of the XHsDecl
case. As a result, the coverage checker concludes that the XHsDecl case is
inaccessible, so it can be removed.
(See Note [Strict argument type constraints] in GHC.HsToCore.PmCheck.Oracle for
more on how this works.)

Bottom line: if you add a TTG extension constructor that uses NoExtCon, make
sure that any uses of it as a field are strict.
